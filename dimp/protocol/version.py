class MetaType:

        @enum MetaType

        @abstract Defined for algorithm that generating address.

        @discussion Generate and check ID/Address

            MetaType_MKM give a seed string first, and sign this seed to get
            fingerprint; after that, use the fingerprint to generate address.
            This will get a firmly relationship between (username, address and key).

            MetaType_BTC use the key data to generate address directly.
            This can build a BTC address for the entity ID (no username).

            MetaType_ExBTC use the key data to generate address directly, and
            sign the seed to get fingerprint (just for binding username and key).
            This can build a BTC address, and bind a username to the entity ID.
