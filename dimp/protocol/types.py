        @abstract A flag to indicate what kind of message content this is.

        @discussion A message is something send from one place to another one,
            it can be an instant message, a system command, or something else.

            DKDMessageType_Text indicates this is a normal message with plaintext.

            DKDMessageType_File indicates this is a file, it may include filename
            and file data, but usually the file data will encrypted and upload to
            somewhere and here is just a URL to retrieve it.

            DKDMessageType_Image indicates this is an image, it may send the image
            data directly(encrypt the image data with Base64), but we suggest to
            include a URL for this image just like the 'File' message, of course
            you can get a snapshot of this image here.

            DKDMessageType_Audio indicates this is a voice message, you can get
            a URL to retrieve the voice data just like the 'File' message.

            DKDMessageType_Video indicates this is a video file.

            DKDMessageType_Page indicates this is a web page.

            DKDMessageType_Quote indicates this message has quoted another message
            and the message content should be a plaintext.

            DKDMessageType_Command indicates this is a command message.

            DKDMessageType_Forward indicates here contains a TOP-SECRET message
            which needs your help to redirect it to the true receiver.

        Bits:
            0000 0001 - this message contains plaintext you can read.
            0000 0010 - this is a message you can see.
            0000 0100 - this is a message you can hear.
            0000 1000 - this is a message for the robot, not for human.

            0001 0000 - this message's main part is in somewhere else.
            0010 0000 - this message contains the 3rd party content.
            0100 0000 - (RESERVED)
            1000 0000 - this is a message send by the system, not human.

            (All above are just some advices to help choosing numbers :P)
